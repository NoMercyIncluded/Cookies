First - need to create stable stellar systems.
This requires a convenient GUI helping with design and tests.
Saving and loading various settings.
Main menu independent of game instance - instances with their own menus or tabs in main menu?
-> distill easy to use game instance.

Top priority:
1. Convenient world creating - with GUI:
- Star, planet, moon and other celestial bodies creator
- Solar system creator (calculating, for example, orbits and speed of the planets needed to maintain static orbit)
- Saving, loading and reusing those components
- Ability to integrate them in space

2. Convenient world testing:
- GUI and camera
- analysis tools - gathering data and saving it, detecting anomalies
- the previous possibly reinforced with graphic in-simulation feedback, i.e afterimage and orbit drawing
